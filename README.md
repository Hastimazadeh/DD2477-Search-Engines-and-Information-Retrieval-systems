# Search Engines and Information Retrieval Systems (DD2477) - Assignments

This repository contains the solutions for the three assignments for the Search Engines and Information Retrieval Systems course at KTH (2023). 

The assignments' descriptions can be found in the `assignmentPDFs` directory.

The calculation files and their results for each assignment can be found in the `calculation` directory.

The `ir` directory contains most of the implementations.

There are comments within the code to explain which part of the code implemented belongs to which section of each assignment.

The code skeletons were written by Johan Boye in 2017, and the files that have been modified are indicated with "Edited by Hasti Mohebali Zadeh, 2023" at the top of the file.
